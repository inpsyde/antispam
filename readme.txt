Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 3.3.1

Simple antispam solution. Scrambles a word and pieces it together automatically via JavaScript. Users with JavaScript enabled won't notice anything. Those who have JavaScript disabled have to type the word into a textfield. This plugin won't help against a targeted spam attack but should prevent a lot of random spam.
