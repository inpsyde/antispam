# Inpsyde AntiSpam
Simple antispam solution with the magic of javascript

## Description
Simple antispam solution. Scrambles a word and pieces it together automatically via JavaScript. Users with JavaScript enabled won't notice anything. Those who have JavaScript disabled have to type the word into a textfield. This plugin won't help against a targeted spam attack but should prevent a lot of random spam.

No remote service needed. Does not send or retrieve data from third party services.
